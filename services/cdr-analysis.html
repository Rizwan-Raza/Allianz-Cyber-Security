            <p>Call monitoring and recording applications used by telecommunication companies generate extremely large
                amount of call detail records (CDRs) in real-time, and companies constantly need to leverage from this
                data to boost productivity. The volume of the calls and data captured by the call monitoring
                applications is so large that it impossible to manually analyse and conclude the behaviour of the
                network.</p>

            <p>CDR Analysis takes call data records from a variety of sources and provides tools to identify patterns
                and trends, as well as look for suspicious patterns in calls which may indicate fraud.</p>
