            <p>There has been a significant rise in the amount of computer and internet related crime in recent years.
                This is hardly surprising as we increasingly rely on computers and the internet to carry out
                transactions and store and exchange information. The very nature of computers means that whatever you do
                leaves a trail of evidence, but in order to be used in court this needs to be gathered and handled in
                such a way that it isn’t compromised. This is where digital forensics comes into play.</p>

            <br />
            <p>CThough the gathering of digital evidence now plays a key part in the investigation of many crimes, it’s
                also used by a growing number of businesses. The skills of a computer investigator can be useful in
                uncovering misuse of company computers or email, or the copying and leaking of data from within an
                organisation. Our services can of course be adapted to meet the specific needs of the client.</p>
