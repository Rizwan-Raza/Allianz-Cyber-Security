            <p>Cell Phone Forensics / Mobile Device Forensics is the recovery of digital evidence, or data, from a Cell
                Phone using forensic methods. The term mobile device usually refers to smartphones. However, it can also
                relate to other digital devices that have both internal memory as well as communication ability. These
                devices include Personal Digital Assistants (PDA’s), Global Positioning System (GPS) and tablet
                computers such as iPad, smartphones, etc.</p>

            <br />
            <p>Mobile devices have the ability to store several types of personal information such as contacts, photos,
                calendars, notes, iMessage, Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS). In
                addition, more sophisticated cell phones commonly referred to as smartphones or smart cell phones may
                also contain location information, videos, email, web-browsing history and other relevant content like
                that of social media i.e. Facebook and LinkedIn, messages and contacts. Some cell phones are also able
                to report the history of the cellular towers they were attached to when a call was made or a text
                message was sent.</p>
            <p>
                These indications cross-connect with each other and hence, it becomes difficult to get the exact clue.
                In this perplexed scenario, how to gather proof using a single device? Multiple mobile phone forensic
                services & cell phone forensic specialist decode the connections and reveal the hidden fact.
                Using an array of specialized software and equipment designed specifically for advanced cell phone
                forensics, allianz experts are able to extract key evidence from cellular phones, smartphones, PDA’s,
                GPS units and other mobile devices. We are able to extract active and deleted data from many cell phones
                on the market today. Common engagements include the recovery of text messages, pictures, videos and call
                history logs. Additionally, we are able to perform advanced analyses such as chip-off forensic
                extractions, spyware checks to determine if surveillance software is installed on a device, operating
                system and application artifact recovery (internet history, emails, tweets, etc.), and localization
                services to determine where a phone has been.
