            <p>Allianz Digital Forensic Investigations practice provides broad services related to the collection,
                forensic analysis and reporting of digital evidence in legal, criminal, regulatory and other
                investigations and proceedings. We have many years of experience in presenting digital evidence in the
                most heavily scrutinized matters. We can help build a strong case upon collecting and analysing a broad
                range of artifacts, which when properly analyzed will conclusively answer the most relevant questions.
