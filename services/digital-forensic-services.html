                    <p>When an intrusion occurs it is our job to help you investigate. Our Digital Forensic Services
                        team arms you with a set of investigators who know how to find and follow the digital trail that
                        cyber-criminals leave behind.</p>

                    <h4>Where things went wrong.</h4>
                    <br />
                    <p>During the forensic investigation, allianz works hand-in-hand with your team to mitigate risk by
                        allowing proper containment of incidents - we study the information we discover and work with
                        you to understand where the security system failed and to improve handling of the event. We look
                        at your existing security handling plans and make suggestions for improvement.</p>

                    <h4>Meet security compliance requirements</h4>
                    <br />
                    <p>It is very important that a complete forensic examination is conducted and a comprehensive report
                        is kept on file to not only meet compliance requirements but to also prove a proper response was
                        generated. A breach exposes your company data to hackers. If you fail to have a proper
                        investigation and take corrective action - you are potentially open to litigation if sensitive
                        information is taken.</p>
